# influxdb concepts
# bucket - database
# measurement - name of table -
  - acts as a container for tags, fields, and the time column, and the measurement name is the description of the
  - data that are stored in the associated fields
# field
  - Fields are a required piece of the InfluxDB data structure - you cannot have data in InfluxDB without fields.
  - Itâ€™s also important to note that fields are not indexed

# tags
  - Tags are optional
  - Tags are made up of tag keys and tag values
  - Tags are index

# A point represents a single data record that has four components: a measurement, tag set, field set, and a timestamp.
  A point is uniquely identified by its series and timestamp.
